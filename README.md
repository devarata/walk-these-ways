# Walk-these-ways (CS562: Advanced Robotics)

## Introduction

This project, part of CS562: Advanced Robotics, is an endeavor to train and demonstrate a robotic dog's ability to navigate and avoid obstacles. It leverages the Isaac Gym Simulator and the Unitree Go1 robot, focusing on achieving precise locomotion and navigation in a virtual environment. The project's ultimate goal is to enable the robot dog to move from point A to point B while avoiding collisions, simulating real-world scenarios where such technology could be vital in search and rescue, agriculture, logistics, and healthcare.
